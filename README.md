# QPosts cog

This is a cog (plugin) for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) that gathers new Q posts from 8kun.top and posts them in Discord.

To add it to your Red instance:

```
!repo add qposts-repo https://github.com/learnedtocode/qposts-cog
!cog install qposts-repo qposts
!load qposts
```

To update the cog if changes are made here:

```
!repo update qposts-repo
!cog update qposts
```

More info about other commands is in the command help.
